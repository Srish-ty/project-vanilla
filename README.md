# Getting Started with setting up the project in local

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to be followed

1. Clone the forked repo
2. switch to new branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

3. Install pnpm globally

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

4. Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

5. Start the development server
   In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

6. For ESlint checks

```bash
pnpm lint
```

to fix using `ESlint`:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

7. For Prettier checks

```bash
pnpm prettier
```

to fix using `Prettier`:

```bash
pnpm prettier:fix
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
